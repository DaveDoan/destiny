                    <p>
                      My name is, Dave, but in the online gaming world I go by 'Dog'.
                    </p>
                  
                    <p>
                      I've been a Destiny player since the D1 (Destiny 1) alpha back in 2014.  I first experienced the game at my best friend's house on his Playstation 3 system and even though it was just an alpha build release, I was immediately wanting more. The gameplay mechanics felt great, the environments were gorgeous, and I was able to fulfill my 'space wizard' gaming fantasy.  Bungie (the game's developer) already gained success from the Halo franchise and did not disappoint with Destiny.  In 2017, Destiny 2 was released and it is the current, and as of 2022, the future version of the Destiny franchise as stated by Bungie.  My main character class all through D1 and the first year of D2 was a Warlock.  With the release of the <em>Shadowkeep</em> expansion I switched to a Hunter as my main class and never looked back.  I do enjoy all the classes but the Hunter will always be my main.
                    </p>
                  
                    <p>
                      The buildcrafting within the game, in my opinion, is currently in the best form it has been, especially with the subclass 3.0 reworks in 2022, as we near the end of the <em>Witch Queen</em> expansion. It's only going to get better with the recent changes announced by Bungie for the upcoming <em>Lightfall</em> expansion in February, 2023.  This website is a personal website for all of my current character builds in Destiny 2 to share with friends.
                    </p>

                    <p>A few <strong>Disclaimers</strong> first before you continue to the builds....</p>

                    <ul class="list-group">
                        <li class="list-group-item">1) These builds are as of January, 2023, and use the Elemental Well system which is being changed with the <em>Lightfall</em> expansion.  Elemental Well mods that I have slotted on armour are not in any particular order, unless they are specific to a certain armour piece.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">2) I don't use popular 'meta' builds.  A major part of the game that I love is creating my own builds and all of my builds synergize and work around my play style and are what I wanted to achieve with each.  At times my builds do use items that popular 'meta' builds use but those builds were never intended to be a 'meta' build.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">3) These are my main builds for each class.  I have other builds, 9 on my Hunter for example, but I am only posting my main builds.  In the build summary I will reference items you can swap out to achieve different results or for different situations.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">4) I have used my builds in all end-game content with success, including Grandmaster Nightfalls.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">5) I'm a PVE player and not a PVP player and my builds reflect that.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">6) Finally...If you are here, most likely you are a Destiny player and/or a gamer of some sorts.  I use some general gaming terms and lots of Destiny specific terms on this site.  It's assumed you are familiar with some or all of these terms and I won't be 'hand holding' by explaining every single term.  Google is your friend!</li>
